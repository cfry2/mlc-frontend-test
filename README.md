## Preface
Thank you for taking your time in considering me for the front end developer role at MLC. This is an example of how I would structure my React frontends however. Further additions given time would have been adding in unit tests and implementing linting tools at build time.

## Running
The test is built using CRA so the ordinary commands should work:

`npm install`

`npm start`

`npm run build`


Tested with node version `v12.16.1`
